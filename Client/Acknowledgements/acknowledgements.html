        <strong>1.</strong> Your account, along with your files will be deleted
        due to inactivity after 90 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong> All files hosted on this platform are publicly
        accessible, provided that the URL of the file is known. It is not
        recommended to upload files that are critical/personal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.</strong> If a large, time consuming file upload gets
        interrupted due to a powercut at my house shutting down the server, that
        is not my responsibility. Do not blame me, blame my electricity grid.
